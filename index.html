    <p>Tigger is a fictional tiger character originally introduced in A. A. Milne's book The House at Pooh Corner. 
        Like other Pooh characters, Tigger is based on one of Christopher Robin Milne's stuffed toy animals. 
        Tigger appears in the Disney cartoon versions of Winnie the Pooh and has also appeared in his own 
        film.

            He is known for his distinctive orange and black stripes, large eyes, a long chin, a springy tail, 
            and his love of bouncing. As he says himself, "Bouncing is what Tiggers do best." 
            Tigger never refers to himself as a tiger, but as a "Tigger". Although he often refers to himself in the third person plural 
            (e.g. "Tiggers don't like honey!"), he maintains that he is "the only one". </p>
